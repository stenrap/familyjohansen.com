    - Stored procedures used by the db-service:
    
        + [DONE] getUser() - look up a user for authentication
        
        + [DONE] createPost() - create a new post
        
        + [DONE] getSinglePost() - read a single post by title
        
        + [DONE] getPostsByDate() - read 10 recent posts for the home page (based on an offset)
        
        + [DONE] getPostsByAuthor() - read 10 recent posts by an author (based on an offset)
        
        + [DONE] getPostsByTag() - read 10 recent posts by tag (based on an offset)

        + [DONE] updatePost() - update a single post by id
        
        + [DONE] deletePost() - delete a single post by id


Routes:

    - Each post will be accessible via a friendly URL derived from the title and consisting of only lowercase letters and dashes:
    
        http://www.familyjohansen.com/our-story
    
    -


Templates:

    - All templates are written in Jade.

    - Each template is compiled into JavaScript so that client-side rendering can be done by passing a model to a JavaScript function.

    - Compiled templates are accessible as functions of the form 'template_path_to_file(model)', where the path begins at /views.

        + For example, if you have a template in this file...

            /views/admin/post.jade

        ...then in JavaScript you would make this call to render it (after getting the model): template_admin_post(model);

    - The less flexible workflow is:

        + Create or modify a template in Jade

        + Invoke Jade from the command prompt to compile the template into a .js file named after the .jade file

        + Include the appropriate .js file in the appropriate rendered page

    - Here's an example of compiling a template into JavaScript:

        ./node_modules/jade/bin/jade.js --client --name template_admin_login --out ./public/js/templates --no-debug ./views/admin/login.jade
